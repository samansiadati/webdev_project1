    <h2>AI</h2>
    <div><img src="images/ai.jpeg" alt="artificial intelligence"></div>
    <p>Artificial intelligence is the ability of a computer or computer-controlled robot to perform tasks that are commonly associated with the intellectual processes characteristic of humans, such as the ability to reason.</p>
    <h2>Deep Learning</h2>
    <div><img src="images/dl.jpg" alt="deep leanrning"></div>
    <p>Deep learning is a method in artificial intelligence (AI) that teaches computers to process data in a way that is inspired by the human brain. Deep learning models can recognize complex patterns in pictures, text, sounds, and other data to produce accurate insights and predictions.
